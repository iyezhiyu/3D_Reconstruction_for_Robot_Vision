# 3D Reconstruction for Robot Vision
This project is still in progress, most of the codes can not be published at present.
## Introduction
This project aims to reconstruct 3D objects from RGB-D input of robots.
## Modules
* Mask RCNN: refer to [Mask_RCNN_on_YCB_Video_Dataset](https://github.com/iyezhiyu/Mask_RCNN_on_YCB_Video_Dataset)
* Frames extraction
* Projections
* Image Fusion
* Autoencoding for Reconstruction
